            <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Hannah Mayorga and I'm a 17 year old senior attending Warren Central High School. I was born here
                in Indianapolis, Indiana but my parents are actually from Nicaragua. Ever since I was little I've always had 
                an interest in both art and computers. I knew once I got into high school I wanted to take a lot of art and 
                computer classes, and when I did I fell in love with both of them from the start. Nextech helped me discover the 
                perfect job to combine both of the things I'm passionate about which is UX/UI Design and Game Design.
            </p>
